## Deployment

This website is deployed as a **static site on AWS**, using the following services:  

1. **Amazon S3 (Static Website Hosting):**  
   * The website files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) are hosted in an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.  
   * Bucket configured for public access via CloudFront only (restricted direct S3 access).  

2. **Amazon CloudFront (CDN & HTTPS):**  
   * A CloudFront distribution is set up in front of the S3 bucket to provide low latency, global caching, and HTTPS access.  
   * The distribution is linked with an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).  

3. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):**  
   * A free SSL/TLS certificate was provisioned and attached to CloudFront for secure HTTPS traffic.  

4. **Amazon Route 53 (DNS):**  
   * Hosted zone in Route 53 manages DNS records for the domain.  
   * An **Alias record (A record)** points the domain to the CloudFront distribution.  

5. **GoDaddy Domain:**  
   * The custom domain (adataguy.in) was purchased via GoDaddy.  
   * The domainâ€™s **nameservers** were updated to use the Route 53 hosted zone, enabling AWS DNS management.  

### Deployment Workflow  
- Build and update website files locally.  
- Sync files to S3 bucket:  
    ```bash
    aws s3 sync ./ s3://<bucket-name> --delete
    ```
